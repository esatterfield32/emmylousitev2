            <h2><b><a NAME="Summary"/>Summary</b></h2>
            I made this website as a way to show the world who I am. I originally made it over the summer because I wanted to start a blog, but I started over this fall to make it better. If you saw it before, I HOPE you agree that this website is leaps and bounds above the other one. Since I first published it, I have made many additions, including my recipe book and my porfolio. 
            <h2><b><a NAME="Goals"/>Goals</b></h2>
            When making this site, my goal was to have a professional clean home for all the things I want to share with share with the world. While it is highly doubtful that anyone, but me has regularly visited this site, I was a perfectionist when building this site. Everything is done from scratch. Every line of code was written with love. Though I could have used many different platforms such as Bootstrap and Wordpress to make this project easier for myself, I wanted to use this as a learning opportunity. 
            <h2><b><a NAME="Hardware"/>Hardware</b></h2>
            I guess the only real hardware used here was my computer. I used Jetbrains WebStorm as my IDE and did most of the coding locally before moving the files over to Hostinger, a hosting platform. 
            <h2><b><a NAME="Lessons"/>Lessons Learned</b></h2>
            When I started this project in June, I had never written a single line of html, css, javascript or php code in my life. The learning curve was steep. My original site was heavily based off other example sites I saw as I was learning how to do all this stuff on Youtube. It was really ugly. At least in hindsight, I think so. At the time I thought it looked at great. I don't know what I was thinking. Since then, I have branched out and gotten more ambitious with some of the elements of my site. I learned a bit of javascript and added some more dynamic parts to the site. I also had to learn about backend developing when I built the contact form that forwards information to email. A considerable amount of debugging went into making it secure. Overall, I am very happy with how this project came out. This gave me the opportunity to develop proficiency in front-end development and dabble in back-end stuff. I also got to explore my creative side as I developed how everything looked. Every hour spent on this project was worth it.
