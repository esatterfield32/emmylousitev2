        <p>SmartCaptions
This was a team project that I worked on as a part of HackMIT. Have you ever listened in on a conversation and had no clue what was being talked about? Most of us have. So we sought to 
find a way to give people easy access to resources to educate them on a subject while listening to it. The basic premise behind our project was using text-to-speech translators and natural language processing to pick out the
the most important words from the speech. A transcript would be developed with those words highlighted. If you clicked on one of those keywords a list of resources would appear to give you insight on the topic.</p>

    <p>As a part of ESP Junction, I built a functional calculator using an Arduino Uno, a keypad, a button, a tupperware container,
                and an LCD display. The purpose of this project was to investigate how calculators do math and to recreate those functions myself.
                My calculator can calculator can do the basic four functions as well as calculate trigonometric functions, exponents, logarithms, and roots. <a href = "http://www.emmylousatterfield.online/portfolio1.html">click here for more...</a></p>

        <h3 style = "color:black; text-align:left;">Summary</h3>
    <p>If you watched the video above, how many LEDs do think were used to create the display. The answer is not intuitive.
            In fact, when I first saw a similar project on Youtube, I was way off. The answer: eight. How is this possible?
            Persistence of vision. In other words, the brain can only process visual information so fast. So if you flash the LEDs
            faster than that, you won't even be able to recognize that they're flashing. To take advantage of this, you can move them
            while they're flashing and make cool designs. Or spell words. Your brain won't tell the difference between the moving LEDs and 
            60 stationary ones. I thought this was really cool, and was inspired to build this project. <a href = "http://www.emmylousatterfield.online/portfolio2.html">click here for more...</a></p>

    <p>I made this website as a way to show the world who I am. I originally made it over the summer because I wanted to start a blog, 
but I started over this fall to make it better. If you saw it before, I HOPE you agree that this website is leaps and bounds above the other one. 
Since I first published it, I have made many additions, including my recipe book and my porfolio.<a href = "http://www.emmylousatterfield.online/portfolio3.html">click here for more...</a></p>

    <p> I was a member of FRC team 5962 for 3 years in high school. During my time on the team, I served as the electrical lead for two years and the captain of the team for my final year. Being
in a leadership position for so long gave me a unique opportunity to participate in many roles on the team. I led administrative tasks, organized, founded, and ran several community outreach
events and was in charge of the majority of technical aspects of the team's robots. I was also one of the chief designers and CAD modelers on the team. <a href = "http://www.emmylousatterfield.online/portfolio4.html">click here for more...</a></p>
