            <h2><b><a NAME="Summary"/>Summary</b></h2>
            <p>As a part of ESP Junction, I built a functional calculator using an Arduino Uno, a keypad, a button, a tupperware container,
                and an LCD display. The purpose of this project was to investigate how calculators do math and to recreate those functions myself.
                My calculator can calculator can do the basic four functions as well as calculate trigonometric functions, exponents, logarithms, and roots.
            </p>

                Calculators have been in use for hundreds of years, starting with the abacus, which was an early counting tool developed by the Chinese around 500 B.C. E.,
                developing into the adding and subtracting machine in 1642 developed by Pascal, and finally into more sophisticated machines as time went on.
                People use calculators everyday for a variety of purposes, for work, banking, school, and for areas of study that apply mathematics. So how
                do calculators work? How do they take bits of information, the 1s and 0s, and turn them into the calculations as we see them? This is the question
                I investigated as I worked on this project by building my own calculator.
            </p>
            <h2><b><a NAME="Hardware"/>Hardware</b></h2>
            <p>Button matrices are able to do reduce the number of pins used by using a grid system. All the rows would be an input
                and the columns would be outputs (or vice versa). The outputs from the rows would send a signal that, when a button is
                pressed, would be read by the columns. The inputs scan the outputs row by row (or column by column) to determine which
                button was pressed. This essentially gives the processor a coordinate for the button that was pushed, which allows it to
                decode the button.</p>
            <p>The push button switch was used as a shift key. Whenever the key was decoded, the shift key’s position was taken into consideration.
                If it is pressed, that information, maps the key to a different value than if it is left unpressed.</p>

            <p>The LCD display is connected to an SPI unit backpack, which is a small processing chip that takes care of the job of some of the pins
                on the LCD, onboard. The SPI unit, therefore, decreases the amount of pins being used by the LCD on the Arduino to four, which was
                essential in order for there to be room for a shift key. The LCD with the SPI backpack uses a special library in the Arduino program.</p>

            <p>The Arduino UNO is a prototyping processing board that can be programmed in the Arduino language, a language very similar to C++.
                My calculator used several digital input/ output pins, both for the button matrix and the shift key, and some analog pins for the LCD.
                The Arduino was powered by a 9V battery that is connected to a single pole double throw switch, so it can be turned on and off. The Arduino
                uses several libraries that make using the hardware easier in software.</p>

            <p>State Machines
                Calculators are simply state machines, or machines that start in a state and move to new states based on certain events.
                The state machine I used for my calculator has four states. The first state called “get_first_operand” is the state the calculator
                begins in. In this state it looks for the push of a button on the keypad. If the calculator receives a string of numbers, it turns
                that string into a full number. This state also looks for a negative sign or a decimal point. Once it has received an operator,
                it knows that it has received the full operand, so it saves that operand and the operator and moves into the next state called get_second_operand.
                In this state it looks for another string of numbers which it converts into a full operand. It leaves this state and moves to the next state:
                get_result, once it has received a full operand and the “=” key. The get_result state uses the operator, which it decodes depending on the use
                of a shift, and performs that operation with the two operands. It does all the functions in a subroutine that returns the result to the loop.
                The result can then be operated on if the next input is an operator, causing it to move to the get_second_operand state, or it can be cleared and
                the state is becomes get_first_operand, and everything resets. The final state, get_equals, is used in the case that the operator is a logarithm
                because there wouldn’t be a second operand to look for. Whenever a the clear key is pressed, everything is pressed and it moves back to the first
                state and looks for an operand again.
            </p>
            <h2><b><a NAME="Lessons"/>Lessons Learned</b></h2>
            <p>This setup was used for simplicity and because the Arduino language is fairly intuitive and easy for beginners to write in. However, there were
                some limitations when using this language.</p>
            <p>First of all, in order to receive non-integer result, a the result needs to be a float. Floats can often offer strange results as it can only
                offer accuracy up to 6-7 digits, despite the fact that is can store 32 bits of information (as high as 3.4028235E+38 and as low as -3.4028235E+38).
                So, for instance, if I were to input the number 33,333,333 the float would instead act as though the number was 33,333,332, which when doing calculations
                would give inaccurate results as well. And, unlike other language platforms where you can use a double instead of a float to offer more accuracy
                (up to 15 digits), Arduino doubles offer the same amount of accuracy for both floats and doubles.</p>
            <p>Another limitation of the configuration is a limitation of the LCD. When using floats on the LCD, the screen always displays the number with two
                decimal points. If the number is just “1,” the LCD will display “1.00,” if it’s “20,” it will display “20.00,” and so on. This may not seem like
                an immediate concern, yet in it prove to be problematic in the case that more than two places right of the decimal point is used. In this case,
                the LCD rounds the operand to the nearest hundredth on screen. For example, if the number “9.999” were used, the LCD would round the operand as
                soon as the thousands place is used and the display would go from “9.99” to “10.00,” when instead it should go from “9.99” to “9.999.” The bits
                the Arduino stores are not altered, but this limitation can make calculations somewhat confusing.</p>
            <p>There are ways to combat this issue, though they are somewhat complex and would be unnecessary with another interface. One way to correct this would
                be to display the number just as a string of digits instead of a complete operand, and to just save the operand internally. However, this could lead
                to issues with overflow, and would make printing results far more difficult, as the results are never read by the Arduino as separate digits, but as
                a full number. Another way to deal with this is to only allow a user to use two decimal spots and truncate the number there. This would avoid the
                possibility of the LCD rounding all together, but would restrict the amount of precision one could do calculations with. Either way, further issues
                persist.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, there are limitations in the functions themselves. For example, when using the “pow()” function to raise a number to a power, the result
                could come back inaccurate due to rounding issues. So, to fix this more round-a-bout code had to be used:</p>
            <p>This code essentially multiplies a number by itself second operand number of times. Or is the second operand is 0, it returns a 1, as a result.
                And because there is no Arduino function for performing a root (besides square roots), a different method had to be used as well:</p>
            <p>The code used for the first operand state:</p>
            <p>All the characters are used in if statements that translate them into actual functions, the characters cannot do anything on their own, and do not
                have an innate value to the calculation, without first being parsed.Here, the first operand is raised to the power of the one divided by the second
                operand. The “pow()” function was used because there was no other way to do accomplish this task with a fractional value. The results here have proven
                to be reliable.</p>
            <p>Also, it is important to note that when a button was pressed, the Arduino read it as a character. In order to actually perform functions on the number,
                it first had to be converted into an integer. Also, the Arduino read all the digits that came in as a string of numbers at first. The digits needed to
                be combined to a full number by multiplying the total operand by ten and adding that digit. And in the case that there was a decimal, the digits after
                the decimal point were instead divided by ten to the power of whatever decimal place it was. Finally, if it reads that there was a ‘-’ present before
                a number was, it changed the sign of the operand by multiplying the digits by a variable called “positive” and adding it to the total operand as before.
                The value of “positive” switches between 1 and -1 depending on whether or not it is reads the negative sign before there are any digits present.
                Otherwise, it reads the negative sign as subtraction, saves it as the operator and starts looking for a second operand. The process repeats itself
                for this state.
